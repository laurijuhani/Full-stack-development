# Express application

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Run with `npm start`

Or in development mode with `npm run dev`

# Visit counter

When running the server, visit http://localhost:3000 to see visit counter, or give environment variable `PORT` to change the port.

# MongoDB

The application has /todos crud which requires a MongoDB. Pass connection url with env `MONGO_URL`

# Redis

Pass connection url with env `REDIS_URL`

Exercise 12.7: Little bit of MongoDB coding
Note that this exercise assumes that you have done all the configurations made in the material after exercise 12.5. You should still run the todo-app backend outside a container; just the MongoDB is containerized for now.

The todo application has no proper implementation of routes for getting one todo (GET /todos/:id) and updating one todo (PUT /todos/:id). Fix the code.
